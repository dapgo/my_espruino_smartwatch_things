******************************
    Espruino /Bangle.js
     Standalone app
https://github.com/dapgo/my_espruino_smartwatch_things
******************************

Just upload (.js, .info and .img) files to Storage and run
-----
Note that filenames are different from those in the version available in the official apps loader (github)


Notes:
converting a standalone app in a compatible with AppLoader app has some several requirements or travis will complain.

Usage of tabs or spaces but not both
Names are case sensitive
Folder and executable should have same name
No need of img file but an icon.js
No need of .info file but modify the common apps.json
